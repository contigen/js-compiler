# JS-Compiler

I'm starting this project to better understand how code is structured and how you write good code, I'm basically always curious about how thing are created.
A compiler sounds interesting enough, and a simple one? makes it more easy. Let's go!

## Usage

I'm just starting the project, chill and let me finish, good?
