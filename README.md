# JS-Compiler

This is a basic implementation a compiler in JavaScript.
I'm starting this project to better understand how code is structured and how you write good code, I'm basically always curious about how thing are created.
A compiler sounds interesting enough, and a simple one? makes it more easy. Let's go!

## Code Structure

A typical compiler / interpreter has the lexical, syntactic, and
semantic analyis and the direct execution - [COMPILER DESIGN](http://cnuinfotech-cd.blogspot.com/2012/06/interpreter.html)

Lexical Analysis - raw code to **tokens**(unit of the code syntax) using a **tokenizer**

Syntactic Analysis - restructuring the tokens to a more detailed format, **Abstract Syntax Tree** - a deeply nested object that describes each part of the code syntax and their relation to one another

## Usage

Do your stuff.
